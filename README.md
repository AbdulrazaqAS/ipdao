# IPDAO

IPDAO enables creators to launch and manage a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) centered around their intellectual property (IP). This empowers communities to co-govern, fund, and monetize creative works in a transparent, decentralized way using Story Protocol.


### 🎯 Target Users

IPDao is built to empower creators, fans, and Web3 communities to co-own, co-create, and co-govern Intellectual Property (IP). The platform is versatile and designed for a wide range of use cases like:
- Indie creators or teams (e.g., comic books, animations, music)
- Fan communities wanting to co-own or co-produce IP
- Web3-native brands launching collaborative stories or games



### 🗳️ Voting Power

The Governance Token (GToken) is the backbone of decision-making in the IPDao. A user's GToken balance directly determines their voting power.

**🧬 GToken Overview**

GTokens are ERC20-compliant tokens with extended functionality to support DAO governance.

At DAO creation, GTokens are initially minted to selected addresses — forming the founding governance group.

They behave like regular tokens and can be transferred, held, or used in transactions.

**🔓 How to Acquire GTokens**

There are multiple ways a user can obtain GTokens:

- Proposal Voting: GTokens can be minted to any address through a passed DAO proposal.
- Airdrop Participation: Fans can earn GTokens by completing tasks (see Fan Airdrops section).

> Note: GTokens are not just symbols of ownership — they are keys to governance. Every proposal, vote, and execution depends on your GToken balance.

**🏆 Voting Power Thresholds**

A person's privileges scale with GToken holdings:
- Participation Threshold – 25 GTokens
 - Execute DAO proposals that have passed.
 - Claim revenue on behalf of the DAO
- Proposal Threshold – 100 GTokens
  - Create new proposals
  - Vote on proposals


> Note: All critical DAO or asset updates must go through a proposal + voting process. A proposal becomes valid only if it meets a minimum quorum — a configurable percentage of the total GToken supply.



### 💰 Asset Revenue Distribution

Revenue earned by IP assets — from paid mints, licensed derivatives, or other monetization methods — is intended to be shared transparently and fairly between the DAO and the creators.

**🧮 Current Revenue Split (Default)**

- DAO Treasury Share – 20% (configurable per DAO)
  - Used to:
    - Fund airdrop quests
    - Cover operational or promotional costs
    - Support future initiatives, based on governance votes
- Creators' Share – 80% (remaining amount)
  - Shared among the original creators or contributors of the asset.


**⚠️ Important Notes**

- Distribution is currently off-chain:
The smart contracts do not enforce this split automatically. Instead, the creators must ensure the correct distribution when transferring royalty tokens.

- Enforceability (Future Upgrade Path):
The revenue distribution logic can be made fully on-chain in future versions.



### 🎁 Fan Airdrops

IPDao empowers fans to earn voting power and privileges by participating in airdrops — a fun and fair way to deepen engagement between IP creators and their communities.

**🧠 What Are Airdrops?**
- IP creators can propose and launch airdrop campaigns to reward fan participation.
- Airdrops distribute tokens like the Governance Token (GToken), which grants voting power and DAO privileges. Others tokens can be distributed too.
- Fans earn GTokens by completing tasks and gradually unlock more responsibilities within the DAO.
- This encourages a merit-based rise from loyal fan to governance leader, enabling true community ownership.

**✅ Current Airdrop Task**
- Quiz-based Airdrops
  - Fans complete quizzes to prove knowledge of the IP and claim GTokens or any other tokens.
  - Questions and prizes are set by the creators.

**🧩 Future Task Types (Planned)**

The airdrop system can be extended to support new task types such as:
- Viral social media posts
- Fan art or comics
- Blog or lore articles
- Short videos or animations
- Token staking or LP contribution
