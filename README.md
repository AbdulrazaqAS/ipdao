# IPDAO

IPDAO enables creators to launch and manage a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) centered around their intellectual property (IP). This empowers communities to co-govern, fund, and monetize creative works in a transparent, decentralized way using Story Protocol.



### üó≥Ô∏è Voting Power

The Governance Token (GToken) is the backbone of decision-making in the IPDao. A user's GToken balance directly determines their voting power.

**üß¨ GToken Overview**

GTokens are ERC20-compliant tokens with extended functionality to support DAO governance.

At DAO creation, GTokens are initially minted to selected addresses ‚Äî forming the founding governance group.

They behave like regular tokens and can be transferred, held, or used in transactions.

**üîì How to Acquire GTokens**

There are multiple ways a user can obtain GTokens:

- Proposal Voting: GTokens can be minted to any address through a passed DAO proposal.
- Airdrop Participation: Fans can earn GTokens by completing tasks (see Fan Airdrops section).

> Note: GTokens are not just symbols of ownership ‚Äî they are keys to governance. Every proposal, vote, and execution depends on your GToken balance.

**üèÜ Voting Power Thresholds**

A person's privileges scale with GToken holdings:
- Participation Threshold ‚Äì 25 GTokens
 - Execute DAO proposals that have passed.
 - Claim revenue on behalf of the DAO
- Proposal Threshold ‚Äì 100 GTokens
  - Create new proposals
  - Vote on proposals


> Note: All critical DAO or asset updates must go through a proposal + voting process. A proposal becomes valid only if it meets a minimum quorum ‚Äî a configurable percentage of the total GToken supply.



### üéÅ Fan Airdrops

IPDao empowers fans to earn voting power and privileges by participating in airdrops ‚Äî a fun and fair way to deepen engagement between IP creators and their communities.

**üß† What Are Airdrops?**
- IP creators can propose and launch airdrop campaigns to reward fan participation.
- Airdrops distribute tokens like the Governance Token (GToken), which grants voting power and DAO privileges. Others tokens can be distributed too.
- Fans earn GTokens by completing tasks and gradually unlock more responsibilities within the DAO.
- This encourages a merit-based rise from loyal fan to governance leader, enabling true community ownership.

**‚úÖ Current Airdrop Task**
- Quiz-based Airdrops
  - Fans complete quizzes to prove knowledge of the IP and claim GTokens or any other tokens.
  - Questions and prizes are set by the creators.

**üß© Future Task Types (Planned)**

The airdrop system can be extended to support new task types such as:
- Viral social media posts
- Fan art or comics
- Blog or lore articles
- Short videos or animations
- Token staking or LP contribution
