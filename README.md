# IPDAO

IPDAO enables creators to launch and manage a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) centered around their intellectual property (IP). This empowers communities to co-govern, fund, and monetize creative works in a transparent, decentralized way using Story Protocol.


### üéØ Target Users

IPDao is built to empower creators, fans, and Web3 communities to co-own, co-create, and co-govern Intellectual Property (IP). The platform is versatile and designed for a wide range of use cases like:
- Indie creators or teams (e.g., comic books, animations, music)
- Fan communities wanting to co-own or co-produce IP



### üó≥Ô∏è Voting Power

The Governance Token (GToken) is the backbone of decision-making in the IPDao. A user's GToken balance directly determines their voting power.

**üß¨ GToken Overview**

GTokens are ERC20-compliant tokens with extended functionality to support DAO governance.

At DAO creation, GTokens are initially minted to selected addresses ‚Äî forming the founding governance group.

They behave like regular tokens and can be transferred, held, or used in transactions.

**üîì How to Acquire GTokens**

There are multiple ways a user can obtain GTokens:

- Proposal Voting: GTokens can be minted to any address through a passed DAO proposal.
- Airdrop Participation: Fans can earn GTokens by completing tasks (see Fan Airdrops section).

> Note: GTokens are not just symbols of ownership ‚Äî they are keys to governance. Every proposal, vote, and execution depends on your GToken balance.

**üèÜ Voting Power Thresholds**

A person's privileges scale with GToken holdings:
- Participation Threshold ‚Äì 25 GTokens
 - Execute DAO proposals that have passed.
 - Claim revenue on behalf of the DAO
- Proposal Threshold ‚Äì 100 GTokens
  - Create new proposals
  - Vote on proposals


> Note: All critical DAO or asset updates must go through a proposal + voting process. A proposal becomes valid only if it meets a minimum quorum ‚Äî a configurable percentage of the total GToken supply.



### üí∞ Asset Revenue Distribution

Revenue earned by IP assets ‚Äî from paid mints, licensed derivatives, or other monetization methods ‚Äî is intended to be shared transparently and fairly between the DAO and the creators.

**üßÆ Current Revenue Split (Default)**

- DAO Treasury Share ‚Äì 20% (configurable per DAO)
  - Used to:
    - Fund airdrop quests
    - Cover operational or promotional costs
    - Support future initiatives, based on governance votes
- Creators' Share ‚Äì 80% (remaining amount)
  - Shared among the original creators or contributors of the asset.


**‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes**

- Distribution is currently off-chain:
The smart contracts do not enforce this split automatically. Instead, the creators must ensure the correct distribution when transferring royalty tokens.

- Enforceability (Future Upgrade Path):
The revenue distribution logic can be made fully on-chain in future versions.



### üéÅ Fan Airdrops

IPDao empowers fans to earn voting power and privileges by participating in airdrops ‚Äî a fun and fair way to deepen engagement between IP creators and their communities.

**üß† What Are Airdrops?**
- IP creators can propose and launch airdrop campaigns to reward fan participation.
- Airdrops distribute tokens like the Governance Token (GToken), which grants voting power and DAO privileges. Others tokens can be distributed too.
- Fans earn GTokens by completing tasks and gradually unlock more responsibilities within the DAO.
- This encourages a merit-based rise from loyal fan to governance leader, enabling true community ownership.

**‚úÖ Current Airdrop Task**
- Quiz-based Airdrops
  - Fans complete quizzes to prove knowledge of the IP and claim GTokens or any other tokens.
  - Questions and prizes are set by the creators.

**üß© Future Task Types (Planned)**

The airdrop system can be extended to support new task types such as:
- Viral social media posts
- Fan art or comics
- Blog or lore articles
- Short videos or animations
- Token staking or LP contribution


### üî≠ Project Vision

Our goal is to build a comprehensive onchain protocol for launching and managing DAOs around IP assets, designed with upgradability and crosschain compatibility at its core.

This protocol will empower creators and communities to focus purely on governance, coordination, and value creation, while the infrastructure ‚Äî including smart contract upgrades, security patches, and crosschain operability ‚Äî is abstracted and maintained by the protocol itself.

Today, updating or modifying a DAO‚Äôs contract often requires full redeployment, manual asset transfers, and ownership handover which can all be achieved by proposals.

Once this infrastructure layer reaches maturity, the protocol will generate sustainable revenue through service fees on DAO launches and activities.

Ultimately, we envision a world where launching and running a DAO is as seamless and scalable as deploying a website ‚Äî and we handle the infrastructure so DAOs can focus on impact.
